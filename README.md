This is a game inspired by block building and crafting games like Infiniminer, Minecraft and Minetest. Konstructs is a multiplayer open source game, focused on massive gameplay.

To play the game, you can connect to the official server at `play.konstructs.org`, or start your own server, even on the same computer for a single player like experience.

For more information about the game, how to play it and download links see our web page at http://www.konstructs.org

### Purpose

The project aims at building a client that can render and interact with a block-based world. The goal is to keep the client as simple as possible leaving the game logic to the server.

### History

This client is originally based on [Craft](https://github.com/fogleman/Craft) written by Michael Fogleman. The original project was primarily focused on single player. We forked Craft to focus on simplifying the client for a multiplayer-only game. You can still start a local server if you like to play single player.

### Compile and/or Install
